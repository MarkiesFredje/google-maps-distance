# google-maps-distance

In this project I'm exploring how to use google's Distance Matrix API

## Repo structure

1. `districts.py` generates a dataset with districts close to your home location

## Running the code

* build the environment specified in `environment.yml`
* download the nis_district data from government as explained in `distance.py`
* add the `api.key` file to the repo (one line, with just your key)
